This program should contain two functionalities.
The first one is to encode the given message and send it to the receiver.
The second one is to decode the received message and read it (display it).
When the "Encode and send it" button is clicked, you should get the given message from the first textarea.
When you get the current message, you should encode it as follows:
You should change the ASCII CODE on every single character in that message, when you add 1 to the current ASCII NUMBER,
that represent the current character in that message.
When you do that just clear the sender textarea, and append the encoded message to the receiver textarea.
After that, when the "Decode and read it" button is clicked. You need to get the encoded message from the receiver textarea
and do the opposite logic from encoding, subtract 1 from the current ASCII NUMBER, that represents the current character in
that message.
When you do that, just replace the encoded message with the already decoded message in the receiver textarea, to make it readable.
